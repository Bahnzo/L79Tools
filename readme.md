Should be pretty self explanatory. 

Takes your car and outputs average fuel usage per lap along with 
number of laps remaining. Also can use the scroll box to enter a 
number of laps and will give a fuel estimate based on the average
fuel per lap recorded. 

Program creates a .txt file based on the car type and track/configuration.
It stores lap data in this file so you can get an average over more 
than one session. Simply delete the file if you want to use fresh data
(I'll add that option eventually). 

Uses metric or imperial depending on the what you have chosen in 
the sim.
